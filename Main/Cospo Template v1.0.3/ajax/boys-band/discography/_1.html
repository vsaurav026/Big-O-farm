    A strong debut CD that displayed The Wix Boys' playing and performance to very good effect. This album is better than it was meant to be. It's a collection of lyric compositions.

    This album contains several brand new arrangements of famous hits, old-school rock, swing, 90s/80s/70s hits and also some previously unreleased versions of blues compositions. We did an amazing job on the mix, making this album the most acoustic it
    is possible. Each of the tracks mark a significant sound, all the pieces were recorded in high-quality studio. We made it sound as if you are sitting in the same room, sharing the experience with us. Enjoy the virtuoso guitar music of the Wix Boys in
    this fantastic album.
